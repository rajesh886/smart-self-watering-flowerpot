### Overview
The goal of this project is to build a device that monitors the moisture of the soil in a flower pot, pumps
water out of a reservoir as needed, monitors the reservoir water level, monitors light levels, and
annunciates when water is low.
The device can be used in later classes as an IoT device after adding a wireless transceiver.
Most parts for the project, except the flower pot, water bottle, and ARM controller will be provided.
### Hardware
The project will consist of a single board containing sockets for the M4F board, pump motor driver and
pump, moisture signal conditioning circuit, reservoir level monitoring interface circuit, speaker driver,
speaker, and optional battery pack.
The pump will be controlled by a logic-level MOSFET.
The speaker driver uses a BJT whose output is capacitively coupled to the speaker.
The soil moisture sensor is based on resistance measurements.
The reservoir level detection circuit using the fringe-effect electric field of a capacitor along with an
integrator circuit to measure the fluid level.
The ambient light sensor uses silicon based sensor and current-to-voltage conversion to measure the
light level.
The battery level circuit uses a simple voltage divider circuit.

The software will support the following functionality:
###UART Commands
The virtual COM port connected to UART0 will deliver these instructions:
Commands
level Sets the moisture level below which watering occurs
status Returns the level of the water in the reservoir (mL), the moisture level of
the soil (0% equals dry soil, 100% equals saturated soil), and light level (%
relative to reference light source), battery level (V)
pump ON|OFF Manually turns pump on and off
alert LIGHT_LEVEL Sets the light level above which the beeper will sound if water is low
time H M Sets the time of the lock
water H1 M1 H2 M2 Sets the time window (>H1:M1 and < H2:M2) in which the watering can
occur
